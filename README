This is my first attempt at making something like a full game from scratch. No base game to copy,
development programs like Unity or GameMaker. It will be done in C, in which I don't know how to
implement graphics yet, so it will all be text. It will be a text adventure but with RPG elements
such as a character stats and level-ups, equipment, and a hub. I'm thinking some combination of
Dark Souls and Oregon Trail.

Plans changed. No more hub. Linear path, going from town to town.
